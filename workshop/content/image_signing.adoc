=== Relocate Application To Primary

[arabic]
. You will now attempt to relocate/failback the application to the primary cluster.  Before we do that, we want to ensure that any changes made on the secondary cluster are preserved when relocating back to the primary cluster. Open a terminal, login to the secondary cluster %api_url% with your credentials username: %openshift_cluster_admin_username% and password: %openshift_cluster_admin_password%.
+
[source, bash]
----
oc login -u %openshift_cluster_admin_username% -p %openshift_cluster_admin_password% https://api.cluster-x9sc5-2.sandbox2623.opentlc.com
----
+
. You are again going to make an update to the price of the Quarkus T-shirt.  Update the price by running the below commands:
+
[source, bash]
----
POD=$(oc get pods -n globex | grep catalog-database | awk '{print $1}')
oc exec -it pod/$POD -n globex -- psql --dbname catalog --command "update catalog set price = 20 where name = 'Quarkus T-shirt';"
----
+
. Confirm if the price has updated to by switching back to the Globex application on the secondary cluster and refresh the page.  Select the last page (6) and notice that the price of the Quarkust T-shirt is now *$20.00*
