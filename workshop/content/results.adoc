In this section we will investigate the results of the changes you've made in Openshift to enable image signing.  You should still be on the Pipelines screen in the project *software-supply-chain* from the the previous screen.

. Wait until the *app-globex-ui-pipeline* pipeline runs to completion.  This pipeline run would have signed our image and the RHACS check would be still be successful since the policy you enabled verified your image.
[NOTE]
The RHACS image check step will only fail now if the image is not signed with your generated key.
. Tekton Chains will create annotations on your TaskRun when signing your images.  This is a confirmation that your image was signed during this step in your pipeline.  The annotations to look out for are *chains.tekton.dev/signed* and *chains.tekton.dev/transparency*. To take a look at these annotations run the following command:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
cd
TASKRUN=$(oc get taskrun -n software-supply-chain --sort-by={metadata.creationTimestamp} | grep app-globex-ui-pipeline | grep build-image | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}')
oc get taskrun $TASKRUN -n software-supply-chain -o json | jq '.metadata.annotations'
----
+
. Switch back to your Openshift console and click *Pipelines > Pipelines*.  The *app-globex-ui-unsigned-pipeline* run has failed.  Click on the pipeline run and you will see there is a failure on the acs image check.  The error shows that the signature on the image cannot be verified. This pipeline was intentionally configured not to sign your image during the *build-image* task.

. Select *Workloads > Deployments* on the left menu and change the project to globex.

. Delete the deployment *globex-ui-unsigned* and wait a few seconds for it to recreate.
. Click the new generated deployment *globex-ui-unsigned* and open the *Events* tab.  You will notice that a warning has been generated by the admission controller which has prevented deployment due to a policy violation as the image youâ€™re trying to deploy is untrused.

. You can also use the Cosign CLI to verify your image signatures.  Run the following command to verify your latest built image with the Cosign public key you generated earlier:
+
[source, role="execute"]
----
cd
IMAGE=$(oc get deployment globex-ui -n globex -o json | jq -r '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image')
cosign verify --key=cosign.pub $IMAGE
----
[NOTE]
If you receive the error *Error: no matching signatures*, wait 15 seconds and retry the above command.  It is possible that Openshift Gitops has not yet synced your signed image to the cluster.
