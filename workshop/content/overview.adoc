In this exercise, you will learn how to secure and strengthen your software supply chain with image signing and policy enforcement. We will first use Tekton Chains, an open-source tool for managing your software supply chain security, to sign container images, store attestations, and audit pipelines. Container image signing allows users to add a digital “fingerprint” to an image. This fingerprint can later be cryptographically tested to verify trust. This allows users of container images to verify the origin and trust the content included in container images.

Next, we will introduce Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (ACS), illustrating its application in achieving security and compliance for your containerized applications in Kubernetes. By the end of this exercise, you will have a better understanding of how to improve the security of your software supply chain using DevSecOps practices.
